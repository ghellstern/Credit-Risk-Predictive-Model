# Credit-Risk-Predictive-Model
Credit risk predictive model using stacking.  AUROC is used to evaluate performance.

This is based on the Kaggle competition "Give Me Some Credit".  The training and test data can be found at 
https://www.kaggle.com/c/GiveMeSomeCredit/data

The model I uploaded gives an AUROC of 0.865066.  The winning team in the competition had an AUROC of 0.869558.  I ended up not doing too
bad for a weekend project.

Note: If you want to run this model, you may have to do something different than me when it comes to using xgboost.  That is, simply 
running what is uploaded may not work because of how xgboost is installed.
